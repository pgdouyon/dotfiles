#Dotfiles

Just a repository to store my config files.

I have my emacs config on here in case of emergency, but I use Vim primarily and
don't really keep the emacs config up to date.

I'm just an amateur Clojure/Python/JavaScript hacker so my environment is geared
mostly towards those languages.  Feel free to clone and/or take whatever parts
seem most interesting to you.

My Vim setup makes heavy use of a family of plugins by
[Shougo](http://github.com/Shougo), I highly recommend checking his stuff out.
Particularly the [VimShell](http://github.com/Shougo/vimshell.vim) plugin (live
terminal/repl/interpreter inside Vim) and the
[Unite](http://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim) plugin (unified interface for a
variety of search operations: file system, running processes, yank history,
etc.).

##Install

The vimrc is configured to bootstrap itself (to be honest I haven't wiped out my
.vim to test this yet), so installation should be as simple as copying it to the
home directory and firing up Vim.
