#Dotfiles

Just a repository to store my config files for Vim, Git, and Ag.

I have my emacs config on here in case of emergency, but I use Vim primarily and
don't really keep the emacs config up to date.

I'm just an amateur Clojure/Python/JavaScript hacker so my environment is geared
mostly towards those languages.  Feel free to clone and/or take whatever parts
seem most interesting to you.

##Install

My Vim setup is managed using [Vim-Plug][], a minimalistic package
manager for Vim.  Follow the instructions on the repository for how to install
Vim-Plug.  Actual install script coming eventually...
