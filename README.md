#Dotfiles

Just a repository to store my config files.

I have my emacs config on here in case of emergency, but I use Vim primarily and
don't keep the emacs config up to date.

Feel free to clone and/or take whatever parts seem most interesting to you.

Personally I recommend using the help docs (:h) liberally, they helped me pare down
my vimrc a lot from all the cruft I had picked up sampling other vimrcs.
(yes this is the pared down version....don't judge me....)
